         <h3>Life and career Benazir Bhutto </h3>
         <img src="mypic.png" alt="This is my image.">
         <p>Benazir Bhutto,(born June 21, 1953, Karachi, Pakistan—died December 27, 2007, Rawalpindi), Pakistani
            politician who became the first woman leader of a Muslim nation in modern history. She served two terms as
            prime minister of Pakistan, in 1988–90 and 1993–96.
            Bhutto was the daughter of the politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was the leader of Pakistan from 1971
            until 1977. She was educated at Harvard University (B.A., 1973) and subsequently studied philosophy,
            political science, and economics at the University of Oxford (B.A., 1976) before completing a postgraduate
            degree in international law there (M.A., 1977).

         <h3>First and second terms as Pakistan’s first female prime minister</h3>
         <p>On December 1, 1988, Bhutto became the country’s first female prime minister and the head of its first
            civilian government since the dissolution of her father’s government in 1977. She formed a fragile coalition
            with independent parliamentarians from her home province of Sindh, but they left the coalition the following
            year as ethnic tensions in that province escalated. Without their support Bhutto was unable to pass
            legislation to address Pakistan’s critical issues, including widespread poverty, governmental corruption,
            and increasing crime. Meanwhile, she bore the brunt of a discordant relationship with the military
            leadership. In August 1990 the president of Pakistan, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, dismissed her government on charges
            of corruption and other malfeasance and called for new elections. Bhutto’s PPP suffered a defeat in the
            national elections of October 1990, and thereafter she led the parliamentary opposition against her
            successor, Nawaz Sharif.

            In elections held in October 1993 the PPP won a plurality of votes, and it succeeded in beating out Sharif’s
            Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) party in every province—including Sharif’s home province of Punjab—except
            Balochistan. In her second term, Bhutto made headway in Pakistan’s relations abroad, attracted foreign
            investment in the country, and implemented social programs. Moreover, she had an important ally in the
            president, Farooq Leghari, who was a member of the PPP. But Pakistan continued to experience an unstable
            economy and a decline in law and order. Meanwhile, a dynastic spat embroiled her in scandal as her brother,
            Murtaza, accused her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, of corruption. With Bhutto losing public confidence amid her
            mounting troubles, Leghari dismissed her government in November 1996.</p>
